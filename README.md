# Architecture-of-Learning-Systems-Robocode
Robocode is a game created by IBM, and is used as the most popular tool for various topics in Machine Learning including Backpropagation, Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks.

I created a tank in the Robocode which fights with other tanks in the game and defends itself and wins the battles, and simulated the enviornment using Eclipse in Java

1. First technique used is Backpropagation, which demonstates the learning behavior by updating the weights and Bcakpropagating it in the network.
2. Secondly, I used theories of RL and look-up table (LUT), which helped the robot to improve the winning rate from 38% to 80% eventually.
3. Thirdly, I implemented neural network with back-propagation (BP) learning to replace LUT, which helped the robot to improve the winning rate to 85%.
